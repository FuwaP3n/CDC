# CtorageDatabaceCystem
Basically it is a tool that will help to make your disk clean

So when you are doing a backup, some of your files might not change, but they will take twice more space if there are two same files on the disk. What if you are cloning stuff from two of your devices and they have the same file? This program will resolve this issue and save space and time for uploading files!

### Functions
- Automatically creates links to the earliest file and stores them
- Creates a list of changes (like git checksum or git log)
- Special module to resolve issues with links
- File that allows to ignore some files
- Script that will read from a file to resolve linking
- Different level of comparison (for example, only by name and weight, date, hashsum and etc. )

### Why?
I have a server with only 500Gb of free storage and maybe my internet isn't as fast as I wanted, so it will be cool to have something like this!
